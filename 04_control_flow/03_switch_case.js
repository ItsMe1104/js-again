// switch case :- Just like multiple if-else statements
// It is mainly used for checking equality of a value with a series of other values. 
// Whichever value from that series of value proves to be equal, we execute that block of code

// 1) Syntax :-
/*
switch (key) {
    case value:
        ...
        break;

    default:
        break;
}
*/
// key is the value we want to check
// default: :- is the default case which runs its block if no other cases from above matches the required value and runs their block

// Since we do not define blocks for every cases with braces {}, hence we need to add a 'break' statement for every case block marking its end. 

//If we dont put break statement then it will execute all the cases below it till the default case or if it encounters a break statement in between.
