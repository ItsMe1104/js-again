//The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
//It is an object, hence to create it use "new" keyword


// A promise is in one of these states 


//pending :- initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
//fulfilled :- meaning that the operation was completed successfully
//rejected :- meaning that the operation has failed.



//1) Creating promises :-
const promiseOne = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    //Do an async task
    //DB calls, cryptography, network'

    
});
