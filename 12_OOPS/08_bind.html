            //hence it does not have any server property
            //hence we would have to bind / attach current this with the above this to get server
            //hence we used this.handleClick.bind(this) above

            //since we used bind, it will get the current context, i.e the button as well as the context of class React attached , hence we can access class's server property from inside the eventlistener function also
            console.log(this);

    //Requirement
    // ==> whenever the page is loaded an object is created, and we get the reference of button
    // ==> we have a method which tell us on click that the button is clicked and print us server info
